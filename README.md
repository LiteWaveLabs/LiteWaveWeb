This is the Web App for the LiteWave Jugend forscht project.
The Code is based on Janis Streibs db-aufzug project (https://github.com/janisstreib/db-aufzug).
Especially the servlet framework is used by me. 

During development I will add my own code and try to reduce imported code as good as possible.

## Development
The project is written in eclipse, so this is a eclipse project, that can be direcctly imported into eclipse.
### Dependencies
see lib/whatToPlaceHere.txt and static/js/whattoplacehere.txt
